- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I am Blanketier sometimes go by smokey (He/Him)
- I love working on pcbs, computers, HV circuits, CAD, 3D printers, and computers. I am currently running a makers' club at my school to share some of my limited knowledge with people who have even less.
- I am currently working on an SSTC, VTTC, battery bank, and all my school broken 3D printers.
- Currently I have no projects looking to collaborate on I might post some at a latter date and time to see if people have suggestions on what to change and why. Again I am not the best at anything I do.
- If you need/want to contact me you can shoot an email to ericericericericericericerica@gmail.com
